Whole Group: README, txt files and final chnages done through live share.

Bugs: It has an issue with the port numbers. For some reason it continues to run after a period of time and is not shutting down properly even though there is a shutdown method present.

If you have trouble accessing the link, please let us know and we will share it with you personally.

How to compile and run the program: Run the makefile then say "java Main <numNodes> <numCASSwitches> <CCSHost> <CCSPort>"

Files and Descriptions:

CASSwitch.java
   Core switch in a star handles traffic, global traffic forwards to the CCS switch, implements frame forwarding logic, local firewall rules that are recieved from CCS switch, and supports multiple connections through threading. It contains the following functions: CASSwitch(int port), start(), handleConnection(Socket socket), isAllowedByFirewall(byte source, byte destination), forwardFrame(Frame frame), recieveFrame(Frame frame), receiveTraffic(Frame frame), hasNode(byte node), recieveRules(HashMap<Byte, Boolean> newrules), connectCCS(String CCSHost, int port), shutdown(), add(CCSSwitch ccsSwitch)
CCSShadowSwitch.java
   A back up of the CCSSwitch.java. It works exactly like the CCSSwitch.java file, but it is used as a back up if the main files fails.
CCSSwitch.java
   Central core switch for the SoSs network which creates a bridge bwtween CAS swicthes for global communication and implements fire wall rules (globally) ACKs for global traffic, sends local firewall rules to CAS swicthes. It handles traffic between CAS switches. It has the following functions: readFirewall(), sendRules(), checkRule(Frame frame, ArrayList<String> rules), flooding(Frame frame), sendTraffic(Frame frame, ArrayList<String> cas), trafficHandler(Frame frame), add(int basePort, int index), shutdown(), start().
Firewall.java
   Loads the firewall rules from the input file and checks whether specific traffic should be allowed or blocked. It works as a security measure chekcing the files. It has the following functions: Firewall(), loadrules(String name), isAllowed(String source, String destination), and printRules().
Firewall.txt
   Contains the rules of the firewall.
Frame.java
   The frame for the project.
Main.java
   The project is initiated through this class.
Makefile
   The Makefile for the java files.
Node.java
   Connects nodes to their assosiated CAS switch,reads input data and sends them to designated nodes, sends frames/data to the wanted nodes through CAS and CCS, and writes recieved frames/data as an output file. It has the following functions: Node(byte networkID, byte nodeID, String address, int port, String inputFile, String outputFile), connectToSwitch(), simulateError(), simulateACKFail(), send(), recieve(), Close(), and run().
